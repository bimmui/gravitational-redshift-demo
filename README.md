# Simulating Gravitational Redshifts of Schwarzchild Black Holes 

This program provides a simulation of a light waves as it is subjected 
to a black holeâ€™s gravitational well. This program provides accurate, 
quantitative calculations/measurements when user input complies with what the Schwarzchild 
metric is capabale of calculating (r > 2M).



## Setup Instructions
If using the .html file, simply download it and click on
the file to run it in your browser (Recommended if you don't intend 
on editing source code).

If using the .py file, run `pip install vpython` to download the 
dependency. Run the file in your terminal using `python redshift_visual.py`
## Usage
**Recommended to use a mouse 

To zoom in and out, simply use the scrollbar of your
mouse. Panning the canvas is not possible, however, you
change the angle of the camera to view the scene from a 
different perspective.
